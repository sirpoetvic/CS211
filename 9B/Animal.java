// The Animal interface defines the methods necessary for an animal
// to participate in the animal scramble simulation.  It must return a
// character when getChar is called that is used for displaying it on
// the screen.  The getMove method must return a legal move (one of
// the constants NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, CENTER).

	// Each direction resolves to int
	// based on layout of keypad, 8 at top, 2 at bottom, etc...
